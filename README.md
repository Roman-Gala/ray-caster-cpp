# ray-caster-cpp
C++ Console Ray Caster (Windows)

The raycaster project in C++ is a program that creates a 3D-like representation of a 2D map using ASCII characters on the Windows console. The program uses raycasting
techniques to simulate the movement of a camera in a virtual environment. The camera is movable and rotatable, and the program updates the view of the environment based
on the camera's position and orientation.

To create the 3D-like representation, the program uses a grid-based map that defines the walls and objects in the virtual environment. The program calculates the
distance from the camera to each point on the screen using raycasting, and then maps each point to an ASCII character to create a pseudo-3D effect. The result is a
visually impressive and interactive representation of the virtual environment.
